Well, I'll look into it, though it may take a week or two.  I realize
it's off topic for these NG's, but I'm curious if this actually has

interpretations of an anthropologist worried about possible human
implications.  I don't suppose you know of any lion biologists who
ascribe to this hypothesis?
