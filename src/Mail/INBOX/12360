depends on what criticism consists of (well, first what a critic is--
i've doubts kael was one-- she's more a reviewer-- we'll let it go,
though)-- if prose, then kael. if fairness to the object of inquiry,
then sarris.

there are better auteurists, but nobody as influential as sarris in
america. but it's kael who we can still feel today-- she's responsible
for the state of criticism in this country...
 
> wiser and farseeing?

eee. sarris is the immediate response. though i suppose if he'd been
that far-seeing he'd have known auteurship was gonna ended up gutted.
or that the focus of criticism would just go elsewhere by 70s. either
way-- i find it interesting that, despite her blindly attacking
auteurship for so long, kael was, at heart, an auteur-critic. and in
the tradition (well, not direct lineage-- the incest-mutant line) of
the most sophisticated branch of auteurship we got... i mean, her
attacks on kubrick-- personal, extracting the personality from the
work, etc.-- are self-serving cine-strucuralism if nothing else. maybe
i'm thinking of rafferty here.

> less dated?

well, sarris championed von sternberg, whereas kael championed
neorealists (though i may be hazy on that), trashed don siegal, and
was very much an ideological/political critic. you pick.

rosenbaum's the only guy worth reading nowadays. plus the film comment
crowd, of course-- kehr, taubin, and names i forget.
