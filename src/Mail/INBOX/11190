Ridley's last thorough good film was Bladerunner, IMHO.
It had the Look and some Heart.

His next film was Black Rain, which tried to make real life Tokyo 
look like Bladerunner, and visually it did a pretty good job.  But 
the film was a simple, morally doubtful, "Dirty Harry" movie.... the 
cop who doesn't play by the rules etc...    since then, every movie 
he's made has that same problem.  They are Dumb Blondes.  All curves 
and makeup, but no brains.
