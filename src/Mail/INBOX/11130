I don't. I just haven't heard about many confessions and information
given freely by terrorists. Only about some officials saying that they
have discovered important information by interrogating the prisoners in
Quantanamo Bay. I don't know whether to trust that they got any
information or that did they get the possible information without having
to use torture. The point is that I haven't claimed anything, you have.
