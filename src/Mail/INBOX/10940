Although there are 2 films left in the LOTR trilogy, and one in the PT...I
reckon the sagas will stack up like this

1    Original Trilogy...
2    Lord Of The Rings Trilogy...
3    Prequel Trilogy...

Im into Star Wars as much as anyone, but nobody will ever convince me
Episodes I or II are in ANY way, a better film than FOTR.  (Except LOTR
hasnt got any yoda)

Feel free to shout at me for my opinion :)
