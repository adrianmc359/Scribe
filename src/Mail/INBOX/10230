Hasn't my "realness" already been verified for you on other newsgroups, my
friend, by other regular posters? Look me up on google. Reply to me by
e-mail. Yes, shocking as it may seem, Harvard has seen fit to give someone
espousing my litany of opinions an e-mail acct. for the last ten years or
so.

I don't claim it gives me any sort of authority, and I strongly deny that
any conclusions about my intelligence can be convincingly drawn from the
technicality of my e-mail acct.

What it does trigger (and you may indeed only be joking, so take this as a
more general address -- this has become a sore point for me) is a lot of
insecurity that apparently exists out there when some people read the word
"harvard." You guys should relax.  It's just a college. Because of its
high number of applications, it can accept anyone it wants. So it does.
They're not all geniuses, by any stretch of the imagination.

You'll just have to go back to my words themselves to discredit me (I'm 
sure they'll work fine), rather than these poor attempts to divert 
attention from them.
