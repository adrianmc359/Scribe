Yep it is a world wide problem all right.  It was bad enough when the
US and USSR had thousands of nuclear missles pointing at each other. 
It's no better now that Pakistan and India can do the same.  Wasn't it
last year when half the world was worried about a nuclear exchange
between the two.  Yeah it's a great time.

So does Iraq and Hussein "deserve" that capability too?   We should
put it do a vote in the UN.    I'm not talking about nuclear power,
BTW I'm talking about nuclear weapons.  That is what you're talking
about aren't you?

Yep, Iraq does have the right for peaceful nuclear power, if you
believe that's why he's building those plants.   It's interesting that
Hussein is concerned about electric power in one of the oil richest
countries in the world.  Is he concerned about the pollution?  I
personally don't think so.
I personally think he's hiding behind the right of countries to build
nuclear power plants to develop the nuclear material needed for
weaponry.  The nuclear material that another poster had mentioned was
incredibly hard to obtain.  Unless you can make your own of course. 
What can I say?  Anything else just seems incredibily naive to me.

I suppose Iraq is just like all of the nations you've cited, well
except that they haven't invaded a neighboring country in the last 20
years..  By hey, dumb mistake, he was just kidding right?   His
actions betray his words, he is capable of invading another country.

One can also consider the alternatives.   If one considers that Bush
is just looking for a reason to invade Iraq, perhaps opening up one's
nuclear power plants to full inspection might be a reasonable
alternative.  In fact, if the Iraqi's allowed permanent inspectors on
site for the next few years, that really might be a better alternative
then to see them bombed into rubble.   For peaceful purposes only? 
Prove it.   It would be great if there was a real alternative.
