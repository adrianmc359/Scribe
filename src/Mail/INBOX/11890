I'm not seeing this. Most movies are either Widescreen, are able to show either from the same disk,
or have two versions out in stores. I really can't think of any film that doesn't have a widescreen
counterpart.

There is no reason for studios to go to pan and scan only - as HDTVs become more common, widescreen
will fill the screen better - pan and scan will show black bars on the sides. TV shows are
increasingly being shown in letterbox, in anticipation for the growth of HDTV. 

Do you have any examples or numbers? Because personal experience and logic don't seem to support the
premise.
