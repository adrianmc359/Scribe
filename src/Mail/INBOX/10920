I'm not talking about the quality of schools and teachers. Absolute
equality there can't be reached, of course, though one must try it as
much as possible, eg by giving them the resources they need. I'm
talking about free access to this education, regardless of your social
background and parents' wallet.

Like today's garbage man who works so hard for his personal joy and

???

As we all would partly own our production means, we'd have much
greater democratic control over it than we have now, where our
political influence is reduced to making a cross every 4 years.

No, on equality on the highest common denominator.

Yes, because capitalism messed him up.
