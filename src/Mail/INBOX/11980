According to Ebert, Mr. Fisher, while working at Sony Picture as gate
guard, , pitched his screenplay to whomever wanted to listen.  It
worked, because Fox Searchlight is adapting his film and is directed
by Denzel.  If that's true, than that's awesome.  A great rags to
riches story.  Does anyone know if this is Mr. Fisher's first project
or has he had some experience w/screenwriting?
