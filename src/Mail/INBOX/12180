One of the really nice things about LA is that we don't just have art 
houses, we have art house multiplexes.  Laemmle's has a substantial 
number of screens around town, from the 5-screen theatre at the Virgin 
Megastore complex on Sunset to the Monica 4-plex in (of course) Santa 
Monica.  Three or four stand-alone art houses along Wilshire Blvd as you 
drive through Beverly Hills.  Plus the NewArt, the New Beverly, the 
Fairfax... without pulling out a newspaper to check, I'd say that we 
have between 30 and 35 dedicated art house screens in town.  That's not 
counting museums, universities, and places like The American Cinemateque 
at the Egyptian, etc.

What we really don't seem to have much of anymore are repertory 
theatres.  We still have our share of second-run houses, showing last 
year's blockbusters at two-films-for-$5, though unlike most of the art 
houses they're a little seedy and run-down.  But old-fashioned rep 
houses?  I don't know that we have any of them left, truth be told.  
Home video has pretty much killed that business, at least around here.  
But you can see films large and small, from every corner of the world, 
any day of the week, and in clean, well-run theatres all over Los 
Angeles.

Kinda' nice to live in a company town.
