It jams cell phone signals.  Basically they output radio noise on the
same frequency as cell phones, so that the phones can't get a signal,
thus can't make incoming or outgoing calls. To the cell-phone user
it looks like it's just a weak signal.

This one here looks ideal for theatres.

Note that they're illegal in the US because the FCC does not like
things that are used to mess up the airwaves. Also, at £200, it's
pretty pricey just for the convience of cell-phone free theatre
viewing, although others may disagree.
