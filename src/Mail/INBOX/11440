Agreed, I was astounded at the lack of directing skill Mendes
exhibited with this film after liking American Beauty. I've surmised
that Mendes has a style suited to movies that need to maintain an
ironic distance from their characters. He displayed absolutely no
talent for building up a sympathetic identification with the
characters, and no talent for building tension. His shot and scene
transitions in particular were terrible.
