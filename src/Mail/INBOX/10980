Confusing biological evolution and capitalist competition is crap. Is
Mr. Gates biologically more valuable than Otto the Garbage-man? Again:
Capitalism does not lead to the victory of the "best" one, but to the
victory of the most ruthless one.

Stalinism is not socialism. It called itself that way. Was the GDR
democratic because it had the word in the name?

Other way round. Whenever dictators took over, the first people killed
were the communists / socialists. See China, Russia.
