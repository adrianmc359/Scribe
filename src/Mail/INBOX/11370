I don't know what the comical book is like but boy that trailer is
hilarious. I guess the comic strips must be exactly like The Crow and
the first Batman movie because they lift stuff directly from there. My
favorite is how the newspaper artist mistakes Ben Affleck in a
too-small-for-him S&M outfit for a huge demon with wings and horns.

They seem to be trying real hard to make 13 year old boys from the
early '90s travel into the future to see this movie.
