Like I said, been there, done that.   I had a company brunch today and she
came, bringing her 2 year old and her very big belly.   She's scheduled for
a c-section on the 26th.   Meanwhile my son will have his 2nd son this
March.  This Friday I took my grandson to see Disney on Ice show Toy Story
2.  He was enthralled.   None of them will be young long, but I am having a
ball anyway.

Still, my relatives on the two coasts where I can go a couple of years at a
time without seeing them appear to grow even faster.
