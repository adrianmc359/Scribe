One thing for sure, is that you are going to hear a bunch of stuff about Trent Lott being
representative of the Republican Party.  Of course, the Republicans will deny it.
Personally, I do not think that most Republicans ( or Democrats, for that matter) are dyed
in the wool racists.  I will say that Mr. Lott went a long way to refilling the Democrats
ammunition stores.
Nominally, the sitting President is the leader of his party.  Bush will have to call for
Lotts resignation as senate leader.
Now, for all the kneejerk right and left, I am talking PRACTICAL POLITICS here, not theory.
