Celebrities are damned if they do and damned if they don't.  If they
do nothing, they look like they live in an ivory tower.  If they try
to shed light on an issue, they get called opportunists.  Usually the
people doing the name calling have never got off their ass to help
anyone, so the criticism is usually pointless.
