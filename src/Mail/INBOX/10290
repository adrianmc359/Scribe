Agree.  Saying something about the govt when you are a citizen at home is
absolutely fine.  I may or may not agree with what it said, but it is the
citizens right to say it, and if he can get publicity for his position,
that is fine, as there will be opposition with as much publicity as he
gets.
To have criticized the Govt while still in Iraq would have been, IMHO,
"bad form".
