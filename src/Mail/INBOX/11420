Horsepucky.  I own two businesses, and I am not ruthless.  There have been too many
successful people who were not ruthless for me to believe that.  For that matter,
if you want to define "Ruthless", can you find two more ruthless people than Stalin
and Mao Tse Tung?  Some as ruthless, sure, but more?

The variable is the direction of change.  That direction is what defines the
evolutionary survivor.  We ( humans) are not evolving to bigger meaner stronger, we
( At least, I hope, and believe) are evolving to a more intelligent species.
Perhaps, in a million years or so, when man has evolved to a utterly altruistic
being, a socialist world could survive.  I do not think it possible now.

So, the Dictators killed the socialists, and so did the communists.
Sorry, but the history of socialism is not bright.  Are there some aspects of
socialism that we should have?  Oh yes, the parts that work ( such as social
security.  Great idea, the USA cannot let it go under ( politically), but
administered poorly by the politicians. )
Like any "pure" system, Free Enterprise Capitalism can have its abuses.  These have
to be countered ( anti monopoly laws, etc).  But even in the modified form we have,
it's the best system that man has yet devised, and brings more good to more people
than anything else that the human race has tried, especially with large masses of
people.  Sure, a socialistic society can work on a family or small clan level, and
has in the past, but it simply does not work in the long run with large amounts of
people.  Or, at least, that is what history has shown us so far.
