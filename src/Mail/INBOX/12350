Ok, so I'm sitting there watching this thing (Nemesis) and I'm
thinking, "Wow, The Wrath of Kahn had such a great plot that they
decided to use it again!"

**** DON'T READ ON IF YOU DON'T WANT ANY SPOILERS ****

Let's see, the captain of the Enterprise meets up his arch-memory
(he's basically deceived into doing so), who happens to gain access to
a technology capable of destroying a planet (basically, a super-weapon
in the hands of the enemy).  So, a lot of stuff happens, but in the
end the bad guy decides to use the weapon to destroy the Enterprise,
even though it will mean his demise as well.  In the ensuing battle,
the Enterprise gets the crap beat out of it and - of course - the
engines go down (along with the shields).  Well, in order to save the
ship, one character sacrifices himself to prevent the weapon from
destroying the Enterprise...  Oh, but wait, sometime earlier, he was
able to dump the contents of his brain to someone (or else, leaving
the possibility of us getting the popular character back someday (in
some form).

Now, the question is...  Which Star Trek movie did I describe, II or
X???

Seriously, Rick Berman needs to do something new...  This was a
blatant ripoff of earlier Star Trek work.  I mean, we expect the
normal running gags like the ensign getting killed, the bridge crew
being thrown around, and the shields going down, but this actually
ripped off the whole plot....

Very dissapointing.
