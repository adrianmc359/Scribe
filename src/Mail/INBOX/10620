Please visit my site if you are a Screenwriter, Agent, Producer or Manager.
At the site, I provide my email address, send me your loglines if you wish,
send me your thoughts.  There is already an article by Dave Trottier on the
site.  Major Producers, Managers and Agents will be coming by to look at
the community and seek the right matches for their needs.

The site is non profit and free. It is to help us all.  Good luck.
