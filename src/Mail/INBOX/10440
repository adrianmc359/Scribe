Laserdisks (big platter, pre-dvd, large like a vinyl album) (Album,
what's that?) were sought after for the clarity but also the default t
widescreen format. there were a few p&s editions, but the default
expected by the discerning consumer was widescreen.

DVDs started out the same way as early adopters were also likely to be
videophiles and s such wanted their MTV!, er, uh... widescreen format &
stereo (Dolby even!) sound, etc., etc.

I _Never_ buy p&s if I can avoid it. Might even take some effort, but
the $$$ tell the tail to the folks making the decisions. Don't wimp out
and roll over.
