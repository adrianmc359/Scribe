trying reading the nonproliferation treaty

in exchange for nonnuclear power to remain nonnuclear
nuclear powers agreed to search for technical means
to verify total disarmanent
and then to totally disarm when this happens

not only is the usa failing to do so
but shrubs recents meanderings into first strike use
can be seen to repudiate npt

if the usa abandons npt
what is our moral basis to complain if other countries abandon npt
