  You're evil. I just wanted to point that out. :-)

  ObCurrentFilms: They suck. Stay home.

  Okay, just to not be quite so lazy... a branch of my local library has its
mitts on a copy of Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks's miniseries "Band of 
Brothers", which I've been fortunate enough to borrow. Not only do I like it 
better than _Saving Private Ryan_, but I like it better than most anything in 
current release I've seen. Why bother paying for commercial baloney when you 
can see something like this for free without even getting cable?
