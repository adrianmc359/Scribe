I disagree.  More compelling would have been her death because in war
death happens a lot.  The sense of loss could have been made relevant
to a character.

I disagree because you missed my point.  Picard isn't developed as a
character because there's not much in his life I'm convinced he has
personal attachment to.  Part of that may be his acting.  He's comes
off as a very distant person imho.  He's not particularly attached to
his ship and how can he after its been destroyed so often?.  I was
never convinced of his ties with his crew (because he comes off as
distant and reserved).  How do you take chunks out of his life?

Notice how in Star Trek 2 they had the same problem with Kirk and
tried to rectify it by introducing a "long lost son" David and then
spending time building up the importance of David.  They did that so
as to try to have something to tear out of his life when he gets
killed (and they probably figured it was a better option to create a
new personal attachment than to kill one of the crew regulars, which
again could be construed as lack of guts.)  I think Shatner does a
great job of selling his attachment and his eventual loss.

Luke was developed better to me.  I was convinced of his ties with his
foster parents, with Ben, and with Biggs because of his emotional
reaction to them when they were lost. I was convinced he was hurt.
 
But if you want to believe otherwise, that Patrick Stewart doesn't
come off as distant and reserved and convinces you more than he does
me, I won't try to change your mind.

Ok, let's look at that film.  What damage does the Borg do to
establish credibility?  Do they permanently destroy parts of the
Federation?  Do they take chunks out of our hero's lives?  I'm fuzzy
on the film but I believe the answer is no.  They laid seige but were
forced back while our heroes sacrificed nothing of significance to do
it.  Therefore, I don't think they were a nearly as much of a
compelling nor interesting threat in that film compared to other war
films.

Empire was not as good as ANH.  You can begin to see Lucas getting
scared with his newfound franchise.  The stormtroopers are turned into
imbeciles.  In ANH, they are shown to be a capable, credible and
ruthless by killing the Jawas and Luke's family and hunting down Luke.
 The stormtroopers drop into the background in ESB as nothing more
than rebel laser fodder.  The Empire also fails to deal out massive
casualties when compared to ANH.  None of the heroes get killed.  Luke
is hit emotionally again with the revelation that Vader is his father,
which was good.  Lukes loses his hand.  Its an ok film, but there's no
way it compares as a compelling war film like ANH.

In ROTJ, the stormtroopers become a punchline with the Ewoks kicking
them around.  That sequence was where the franchise became garbage. 
Han Solo became an imbecile.  That's a long fall from the cantina
scene 2 films ago.  The heroes now suffer no casualties and no
emotional hits that I can think of.  The heroes have to make no
sacrifices to win.  Yoda dies but it wasn't at the hands of the Empire
and Luke seemed disaffected by it anyway.  Lucas had become afraid to
take risks.  All of this is why is was not a compelling story.

Don't get me started on Episodes I and II.

All the writer has to do is have the crew flip some switch Data set up
in secret before he "jumped ship" and he comes back as 100% Data.  Or
maybe they'll have to find some key part floating out in Romulan space
to connect with B4 to bring him back.  "The search for Data".
