*****---Just a rumor.  Very unsubstantiated*******

"According to [Australia's] magazine NW, Eminem is the frontrunner now
for the role of the veteran Caped Crusader in Batman vs Superman. The
Hollywood Reporter also spoke to Alan Horn, the president and chief
operating officer of Warner Bros, who said the film will indeed be
happening but after the solo "Bats" and "Supes" projects." -
