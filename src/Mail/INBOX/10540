No kidding!  The ranting and raving about an individual who knew he
shouldn't run in 2004 and, in fact, would probably not have gotten the
nomination.

The biggest complaint against Gore was that he virtually eliminated
the "good-will" the populace had towards the Clinton administration
and lost to Bush.  (i.e. it wasn't that Bush ran a good campaign but
that Gore ran an inept one).   And yes there was a lot of goodwill
about the Clinton administration (despite Republican ranting and
raving)

In any case, the democratic party still has the same problem, no real
worthy candidates and no real message.   The only two I know of are
Lieberman and Kerry and I really see either of them having a
snowball's chance in hell.
As far as the message, I'm pretty much a Democrat and I have no idea
what the message of the Democratic party is these days...
