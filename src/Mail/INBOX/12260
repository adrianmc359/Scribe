it also gets confused because humans have both a genetic evolution
and a cultural evolution
and cultural evolution has different mechanisms than genetic

also h sapiens is the first species capable of examning its own genes
and modifying them directly
rather wait for the vagaries of nature to create new mutations
and select which are successful
