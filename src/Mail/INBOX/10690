It's news to me. I haven't been following the papers for a week, so could 
you post the link to that confession, please?

BTW 'nuclear facilities' and 'nuclear reactors' are different things. You 
can have an industrial plant where you produce radioactive isotopes (like 
cesium, barium etc.) for commercial and medical use, and that would be a 
'nuclear facility', but not a 'nuclear reactor' (where you have nuclear 
fuel in supercritical quantities for controlled burning).
