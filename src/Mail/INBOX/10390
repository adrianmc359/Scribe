But in a war movie its less compelling.

Can't recall there so I might be wrong, sure.

Dunno.  I would have to know what story your talking about to be able

ANH was the only good Star Wars film, imho.  With each movie, Lucas
has gotten less and less daring.  Nowadays he advances his storyline
by having someone bumble and stumble.  I don't feel Sidious is doing
enough damage in these last two films.  I mean when we first meet Han
Solo he kills Greedo in cold blood in the cantina to avoid paying a
debt.  And this guy turns out to be your hero!  Think about that. 
Think about the complexity of Solo.  Where does that scene even fit
into the current Star Wars universe kiddie-fare that we are being fed
with episodes I & II?  It doesn't.

Data hooked himself up with that cable with b4 sitting backs facing
each other.  They talked about how they were downloading all of Data's
experiences into b4 to see if that would help the abandoned android
and if it would be a wise move.  They then noticed b4 had two separate
memory banks or whatever.  Its much like when Spock "downloaded"
himself into the doctor in "Khan".
