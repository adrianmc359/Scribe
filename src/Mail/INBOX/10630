I disagree. What was compelling was her coming to the rescue, adding 
another player to the mix, and then failing but not being completely 
invalidated as an ally.

I'd say that you are, yes. Compared to Luke Skywalker, Picard IS a 
character of Shakespearean complexity.

Yep, it was cool. I think Empire was even better. But it was the last of 
the good ones.

Disappointingly true, though it would fit in the muddled Clones without 
too much trouble. In fact the assasisin-chase on Coruscant that began that 
movie had a very ANH vibe.

: Data hooked himself up with that cable with b4 sitting backs facing

: experiences into b4 to see if that would help the abandoned android
: and if it would be a wise move.  They then noticed b4 had two separate
: memory banks or whatever.  Its much like when Spock "downloaded"
: himself into the doctor in "Khan".

No, he had two seperate data ports (ie, he had a USB and a serial port); 
pay closer attention if you intend to criticize. Data's experiences were 
downloaded almost as a story or encyclopedia into B4; but he obviously had 
only the slightest benefit of them even in the final scene, probably 
because his neural pathways and positronic matrix were not complex enough 
to handle them all. There was some implacation that those systems were 
capable of self-repair and growth, but I've never been clear on that.

Though I'm reminded of when Nomad mind-wiped Uhura and she had to be 
re-educated from scratch, I don't think B4 will turn into Data overnight. 
He's going to be some new creature with partial and imperfect access to 
Data's identity.

And I don't imagine he'll start in Starfleet, even if he joins, at Data's 
rank.
