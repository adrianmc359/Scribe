Well, if we presume he didn't get dishonorably discharged (and, let's face
it, if mass genocide won't get you a DD, nothing will :), then he probably
has the same rights/privileges that retired military have in real life,
which means they get to wear their old uniform at dress functions.

Most don't, of course -- it depends on the setting.  But obviously at
a ceremony with a majority of attendees and almost the entire wedding party
in dress uniform, he'd wear his.
