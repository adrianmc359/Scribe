who'd you put in the role of kane?

bush?
bill gates?
princess diana?
her arabian lover?
britain's stupid queen?
some baseball player?
some weird hollywood director like ron howard?

what style would you put on the movie?

hip hop montage?
bazinian long take?
collage a la svenkmajer?
hip postmodernism a la almodovar plus lynch minus oliver stone?
avant-garde like maya deren?
or real good welles like in maggo ambersons and touch of evil, so so much
better than shitty citizen kane.

would you put julia roberts in the role of kane?
would you put julia roberts in the role of his girlfriend?

would kane be fat or thin?
would he be american?
would he be an austrian neo-nazi?

would the movie be in black and white or yellow and orange?

do you think it would be a hit, like titanic or lord of rings?
