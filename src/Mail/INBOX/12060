Eeg, I think The Search for Spock is head-and-shoulders above any other Trek
film except for The Wrath of Khan.  Its biggest problem (which, to be fair,
was a very big problem) is that it set the franchise on a crippling path by
making our heroes renegades, and Paramount was not willing to see that through
to a satisfying conclusion, resulting in the awful Voyage Home and stripping
the later films of credibility (though Final Frontier and Undiscovered Country
were both basically unwatchable no matter what their context).

I liked B-4.  That he was used sparingly helped.

Worf always gets the best lines.  "Very astute."

What struck me while watching Nemesis was how outdated it felt.

Sure, in the sixties maybe it was (kind of) plausible that the ship would
shake from weapons impacts, and that damage to one part of the ship would
cause other parts to explode or become non-functional.  That's hard to buy
today.  The Trek universe feels like a cartoon world, where things work (or
don't) at the whim of an omnipotent creator, and technology we have today
(firewalls, redundant functionality, security guards) seem absent in the 24th
century.

You mean other than never coming close to equalling those three seasons back in the sixties, right?

>and "First Contact" is one of the best films.

Assuming you're not looking for characterization or meaning, and you want to
see the core attribute of the Borg (an implacable, collectivist hive-mind)
rendered irrelevant (by the Borg Queen, as silly and unnecessary an invention
as NextGen has produced).

Neither The Voyage Home nor First Contact really worked.  The former was
little more than a laugh-fest, strung over the thinnest of plots (and I use
the word lightly), while the latter was another muddily-plotted and
often-tedious entry in the NextGen tradition.
