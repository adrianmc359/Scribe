Very interesting show on History Channel.  Focused on the facts and
fiction behind Gangs of New York.  Interview w/ Martin S. too.  HE did
mention that Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day Lewis) in the film was based
on a real Bill the Butcher.  The only thing was that the real Bill the
Butcher was never around in the events depicted in the film.  But
there was a real Bill the Butcher, a nasty SOB who was anti-Irish. 
The 5 points was highlighted too.

The 2 hosts stood on Mott street in NY Chinatown, site of a big gang
fight, Bowery Boys & Metropolitan vs all others. Also, they were
outside some church, where parishioners protected victims from mean
gangs, which was depicted in the film.
