Around 40 or so years ago, Jack Webb made a film called "The D.I.", about a marine drill
sergeant.  Jack Webb was a fanatic for realism.  The marines I knew at that time said that
it showed the D.I. being too mild a person, but also said that the real language and
violence of marine boot could not be shown in a movie, but was otherwise somewhat
realistic.  Mind, this was when "language" was really not tolerated in hollywood films.
