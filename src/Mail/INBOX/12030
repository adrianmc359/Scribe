Critics' Group in New York Gives 'Heaven' Five Awards

By A. O. Scott

"Far From Heaven," Todd Haynes's heartfelt tribute to the
great Technicolor melodramas of the 1950's, nearly swept
its categories in the New York Film Critics Circle Awards
yesterday, collecting five prizes, including one for best
picture. Mr. Haynes was named best director, Edward
Lachman won for his cinematography on the film, and
Patricia Clarkson and Dennis Quaid were chosen best
supporting actress and actor.

One surprise, given the critics' embrace of "Far From
Heaven," was that its star, Julianne Moore, did not win
the best actress award, which went to Diane Lane for
"Unfaithful," Adrian Lyne's torrid melodrama of adultery.
Daniel Day-Lewis was named best actor for his portrayal
of a 19th-century Manhattan warlord in Martin Scorsese's
"Gangs of New York."

It was perhaps fitting that the screenwriting award went
to Charlie and Donald Kaufman for "Adaptation," Spike
Jonze's mind-bending comedy about the difficulties of
screenwriting, in which Nicolas Cage plays both Charlie
Kaufman and his possibly fictitious twin, Donald. Since
"Adaptation" is loosely based on a book of reportage by
Susan Orlean, it might conceivably have qualified for an
award in the best nonfiction film category. That award
went to "Standing in the Shadows of Motown," Paul
Justman's portrait of the Funk Brothers, an unsung group
of studio musicians whose work brought some of the
label's best-loved hits to life.
