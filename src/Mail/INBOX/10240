What can I say? Any movie that has a heroine "psychically" targeting a 
weapons array/videogame sighting device is tops with me!! :)

And I liked Will's battle in the Jeffrey's tubes with the Reman who 
violated his wife's mind. I like seeing big guys still manage to be 
athletic. And it was interesting to me how the larger battle kept 
interfering with the smaller one inside.

They rammed the ship into something in Generations, too, with Deanna at 
the helm .... but it meant a lot more this time.

The whole thing made me think somebody (maybe even Rick Berman, finally) 
has been watching a lot of Babylon 5. This one had the drama and the 
pathos of a JMS script.
