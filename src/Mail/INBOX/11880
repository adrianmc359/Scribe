It isn't the rare diseases that need publicity or some Iraqi dictator
with 18 palaces who keeps re-arming as his people supposedly suffer
lack of food and other basics.  
The World isn't just.  Twice as many people die from prostate cancer
as AIDS and AIDS gets much more research money.  You could go on
an on.
The sooner Saddam is out of there, the better and we don't need psycho
Sean Penn as a linesman with a bias. Let him go the F--- back to his
B-movies.
