Although I like both, I don't see their careers having much in common.
Fonda is known more for her beauty and Penn more for his brooding,
independence and hothead reputation.

While Fonda is righftully praised for dramatic roles like KLUTE, I
think her greatest skill was as a comedienne. I know she got
BARBARELLA because the director, Roger Vadim, enjoyed seeing her
topless. But she also has perfect deadpan delivery and comic timing. I
think she's also real funny in CAT BALLOU and to a lesser extent FUN
WITH DICK AND JANE where she is a suburban housewife turned bank
robber.

Sean Penn on the other hand is better in intense dramatic roles like
DEAD MAN WALKING. He's a good director too and his movies are always
grim. That's not to say he can't be funny. He was pretty good in that
pretty bad movie where him and Robert Deniero were priests on the run
or angels or something like that, I can't remember. He also tried to
pitch an Austin Powers 2 where he would play a cop from the '70s who
teams up with Austin. I woulda liked to see that.

Anyway, no - Sean Penn does not equal Jane Fonda. They have almost
nothing in common. That's pretty random there bud.

plus, you're a fuckin nutball. I can't think of a single time when
you've posted something about current films in the current films
newsgroup. Go back to your insane canadians obsessed with american
politics newsgroup.
