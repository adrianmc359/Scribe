"Down Among the Z Men" was a stinker no doubt about it. Slightly better was
"The Case of the Mukkinese Battle Horn" Not strictly speaking a Goon movie
(only Spike Milligan and Peter Sellers were in it) but they used a number of
jokes from their radio shows. I saw some TV Goon shows but they didn't work
very well. No doubt about it, radio was their medium.
