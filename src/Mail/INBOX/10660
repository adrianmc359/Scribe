Hillary in '08, then, for sure. We "endured" 8 years of Bill, we will
"endure" at least 4 (most likely 8) years of Bush, we'll do the same
with 4-8 years of Hillary. Though the world will most likely be a very
different place by 2016. Possible WW2.5 in the ME. Diminishment of
Western influence on world affairs, especially the US (we're already
screwing ourselves technologically by sending everything to Asia
(China and India, mostly)- stupid eMpTVy kids who can't tell the
difference between an electron and a photon, nor care about anything
else than the latest Lakers game or JLo record).
