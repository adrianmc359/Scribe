A definite yes on that one. I'd be surprised if there isn't a screenplay 
like that being worked on somewhere. Gates was one of the first American 
execs to make his name the face of the product. If the average joe can't 
name any other CEO in the US, he cam at least name Gates. By the same 
token, few people have any idea what Gates is really like. That makes him a 
natural subject for a modern Kane.
