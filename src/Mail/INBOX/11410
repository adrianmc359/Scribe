Not with appropriate governmental regulation.

PS. Virtually all human activities require a small amount of
regulation to protect good people from the truly evil. Since we don't
have Manwë, we must make do with the consensus of the population. But
we must strongly endeavor not to regulate too much. In general in
economic matters, the market works just fine if not interfered with by
the evil ones. In other matters we must use our best judgement, as bad
as that may be.

PPS. There is nothing particularly immoral or unethical about becoming
rich as long as one does not exploit other people to do it. Exploiting
circumstance is just fine.
