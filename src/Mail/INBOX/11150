Which is why we have public schools. 
However you would deny a parent the right to provide more for his child 
because others can not do the same?
If a parent can afford to get his child special tutoring should he be 
denied that option because another cannot?

Around here the garbage men make good money and have excellent benefits 
and retirement package.

Suupose I work hard make a lot of money and want to set up some sort of 
scholarship for the children in my neighnoorhood, should I be prevented 
from doing that because I cannot do so for all the children in the city?

Generally speaking government should not be involved in business (there

Equality like that can not reached. Some people are simply smarter, more 
industrious, more capable than others. You thus reduce them all to the 
lowest, since not everyone can reach the highest, if you wish to claim an 
equality for all.

Blaming society first.
Because he chose not to try, or saw no reason to try when he could 
subsist on a handout.
