It's rare in this day and age that a film is released with ZERO television
advertising.  Especially so for an action-adventure flick with the cast
and crew this film has.  When it happens -- and it usually comes in
conjuction with a release of the film in a non-holiday weekend from October
to February (and usually a rescheduled release at that) -- it's usually
a sign that the film Stinks On Ice.

Equilibrium doesn't stink.  It's actually quite a nifty little flick.
And those of us who have seen it, and are surprised it doesn't suck,
are commenting on it.
