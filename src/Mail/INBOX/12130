You might want to consider which governments in the 1930s chose to
justify their attacks on other countries as pre-emptive acts of
self-defense.

There could be an unfortunate precedent set if the USUK conglomerate
decide to unilaterally strike at Iraq. It legitimates the idea that
when country A feels some kind of danger from country B they are
justified in attacking said country. With this thinking, Pakistan
would be perfectly justified in attacking India tomorrow. So would
China, I suppose. And vice-versa.

Another way of looking at it is that if one's cause is just, a
pre-emptive strike is justified. So if, for example, one wants to rid
the world of Saddam Hussein, one is justified in attacking the country
where he lives. Or, if one wants to destroy capitalism, or to destroy
the non-Islamic infidels, one is justified in attacking the country
where they live.
