D.G., name-dropping isn't going to get you out of this. 

I won't counter, as I could, about my years as a menial for the south
Marin wealthy. This stratum, as you know, can best be described as being
composed of self-styled FDR liberals.  Think "Barbara Boxer": her home
district, before becoming Senator. If you think that people like this
don't want, and expect to be, waited on, Marie Antoinette-like, by
underlings, you're kidding yourself. I say this with conviction born of
experience. When in public, they *do* however, profess a great love for
equality and fairness and tolerance and admiration for diversity, but yet
somehow find a way to send their kids to Branson, and not Tamalpias, or
even Redwood.

I'm sure they're very apologetic about all this.

There are big jerks on all sides of the political spectrum. It was your 
error to assume that one wing had a monopoly on assholes.
