You have fallen hook line and sinker for the many newspaper and
magazine articles that focus on the child actors who later developed a
self-defeating attitude.  They never tell you the positive stories. 
What about the ones who never had too much trouble or who had trouble
and overcame it?

Examples:  *the entire cast* of "The Facts of Life," *the entire cast*
of "Brady Bunch," Patty Duke, Paul Petersen, Johnnie Whitaker, Jodie
Foster, Robin Morgan (a star of the 1950s sitcom "I Remember Mama" and
now a feminist writer), Alanis Morrisette, Sarah Michelle Gellar,
Britney Spears, Lauren Chapin, Helen Parrish, David Nelson, Rick
Nelson (at least he recorded many songs and gave many concerts as an
adult), Brandon De Wilde (you can read about his adult success in
Pamela Des Barres' book "I'm With The Band"), Jimmy Boyd ("I Saw Mommy
Kissing Santa Claus"), Gary Coleman (If you slam him how well do *you*
get along with *your* parents?), Todd Bridges (If you slam him how do
you know he's breaking the law right now?), Quinn Cummings (nominated
for a Supporting Actress Oscar at age ten, now a screenwriter),
Pamelyn Ferdin (now a nurse), etc. etc.

The list goes on and on.  People like to slam Anissa Jones, *but even
her story* ain't as sad as E! True Hollywood Story says it was.  There
is a Web site devoted to her memory that says the E! people got some
things wrong.  It says she *was not* driven out of the acting
profession by typecasting.  It says she voluntarily quit acting two
years before she died because she didn't like the roles her agent was
offering her.  She quit while she was ahead at age 16, quite an
accomplishment.  One year before she died she worked at a donut shop
in the Los Angeles area.  She enjoyed it and didn't complain about
missing her days of glory.  It was during the last six months of her
life that she hung out with the people who turned her on to drugs and
who were too drunk to help her when she overdosed in their presence. 
There but for the grace of God go millions of 18-year-olds.

Gossip people also like to use the entire cast of "Li'l Rascals" as an
example of the horror of child acting.  Consider that those "Our Gang"
films were made during a very different era (1920s and 30s) when *even
adult actors* got very little money for low-budget films that made
huge profits on television 20 years later with all the profits going
to executives.  Spanky, Alfalfa, etc. had to experience their fame all
over again in the 1950s without getting a penny or a new acting job. 
Clearly, "The Brady Bunch" and "Facts of Life" were produced and sold
by business people who were much nicer.  "The Brady Bunch" employed a
child psychologist and a social worker to make sure the actors didn't
forget about their futures.  The actors who played Greg, Marcia, Jan
and Cindy finally started getting jobs in the 1990s.  Peter owns a
company in Utah that produces family entertainment software.
