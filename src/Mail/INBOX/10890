Again, not relevant.  What is relevant is that he used them.  We are not
discussing invading Europe to stop nuclear proliferation.  It's too late,=
 the
Nukes are there.  The problem is STOPPING THE SPREAD.  You seem to take t=
he
position that just because the West allowed, or did not stop the spread o=
f
Nukes, that it is only just to let them be all over the world.
Why is it that this simply makes no sense to me?  Hell, lets give a few N=
ukes
to the various warring African tribes.
