This is one of the few things I agree with you on. (

I've been into this subject since before DVD came along.  The whole
edited for content (Blockbuster) and pan & scan (even on AMC and such)
is ridiculous. We have had enough of it, it's time to swing back to
rationality. 

Those who dislike the black bars at the bottom of the screen can tape
off the sides of the picture to make it square again.

Some social instruction on what the default is, and should be
(widescreen) is in order.
