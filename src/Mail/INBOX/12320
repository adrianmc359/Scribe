Studios Sue CleanFlicks

"Hollywood's eight major studios on Friday filed a countersuit in a
Colorado federal court against CleanFlicks, which had asked the court
in September to rule on the legality of its business -- removing
scenes involving sex, violence and 'mature language' from videotapes
and DVDs. The studios claim that CleanFlicks' activity amounts to a
violation of copyright and trademark law."

If that means they'd remove Tom Cruise from all of his movies, then
maybe it's not such a bad idea after all...
